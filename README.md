## Description 📖

The Password Generator, you guessed it, generates a password tailored to the user's preferences. The user may choose the length, between 8 and 100, and the type of characters they want in their password.

## Features 📝

This application uses JavaScript to generate the password.

Arrays, Functions, Conditional Statements, a For Loop, and While Loops are implented to do so.

## Takeaways 💡

I learned how to concatinate large arrays into an even larger one then use that array, based on user's decisions, to generate another array of randomized characters.
